# Android Architecture MVA

This repo contains an Android App that demonstrates the Minimum-Viable-Architecture Pattern using the following frameworks:
1. RxJava 2
2. Retrolambda
3. RxBinding
4. Okhttp
5. Gson

## MVA (Minimum Viable Architecture)
It is MVP with additional things like:
* VIPER Entities.
* Router - This follows the Coordinator Pattern
* Interactor - The model layer
* Injection - Simplifies how our classes work and makes us follow S.O.L.I.D principles.

## Is MVA new?
* NO. Weâ€™ve just broken MVC, MVP, MVVM and VIPER to their different components and applying them as we need and see fit.
